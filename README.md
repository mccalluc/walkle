# walkle
Like wordle, but for walks instead of words:
- Every day, it chooses a random point in your neighborhood.
- It gives you the distance and direction to the point, and you start walking.
- When you think you're close, check your guess.
- If if you're not in the radius, it will give use an updated distance and direction.
