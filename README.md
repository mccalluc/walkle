# walkle
Walkle is like Wordle, but for walks.

- Instead of picking a random word, it picks a random location in your neighborhood.
- Instead of guessing the letters, you try to walk there.
- Instead of telling you which letters are right, it tells you how much further and in what direction.


It also uses Cypress for end-to-end testing, ESLint for linting, and Jekyll for static site generation.

Deployed at: https://mccalluc.github.io/walkle/

When developing locally:

```
cd docs
bundler exec jekyll serve
```
