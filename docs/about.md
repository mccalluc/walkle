Walkle is like Wordle, but for walks.
- Instead of picking a word, it picks a location in your neighborhood every day.
- Instead of guessing the letters, you try to walk there.
- Instead of telling you which letters are right, it tells you how much further and in what direction.

The location is based on the date, so anyone in your neighboorhood would get the same location. It's a bit like geocaching.
If travel in your neighborhood is constrained in certain directions
(oceans, highways, dragons, ...), you can pick a neighborhood farther
north/east/south/west.
