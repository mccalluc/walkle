Walkle is like Wordle, but for walks.
- Instead of picking a word, it picks a goal location in your neighborhood every day.
- Instead of guessing the letters, you try to walk there.
- Instead of telling you which letters are right, it tells you how much further and in what direction.

The goal location is based on the date,
so anyone in your area will get the same goal on the same day (if you've selected the same grid size).
It's a bit like geocaching.
If travel in your area is constrained in certain directions
(oceans, highways, dragons, ...), you can pick a goal farther
north/east/south/west.
